                      <h4>Overview</h4>
                      <p>
                          C (pronounced /si/  like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[7] for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. <br>
              
                      <br>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                      <h2>C Variable</h2> <br>
                      <p>
                          Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. <br> <br>
              
                          In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example: <br>
              
                          int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 <br>
                          float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 <br>
                          char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes <br>
                      </p>
                      <h4>C Variable Names
                      </h4> <br>
                      <p>
                                  All C variables must be identified with unique names. <br>
              
                      These unique names are called identifiers. <br>
              
                      Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). <br>
              
                      <br>
                      The general rules for naming variables are:
                      <br>
              
              Names can contain letters, digits and underscores <br>
              Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_) <br>
              Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables) <br>
              Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.br <br>
              Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names <br>
                      </p>

                      <h2>C Array</h2> <br>
                        
                        <h4>Arrays</h4> <br>
                        <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. <br>
                
                            To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets []. <br> <br>
                            
                            To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces: <br> <br>
                            int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                        </p>
                
                        <h4>Access the element </h4> <br>
                        <p>To access an array element, refer to its index number. <br>
                
                            Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc. <br> <br>
                            
                            This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers: <br> <br>
                
                            int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                            printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);
                        </p></div>
                </div>
                <div id='admin_opgave1_billeder2' class='tab-pane fade'>
                  <div class='row'>
                      <img src="./images/c-function.png" alt="" >
              
                      <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. <br>
              
                          You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. <br>
                          
                          Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p> <br>
                      <h4> Predefined Functions</h4>
              
                      <p>So it turns out you already know what a function is. You have been using it the whole time while studying this tutorial! <br> <br>
              
                          For example, main() is a function, which is used to execute code, and printf() is a function; used to output/print text to the screen: <br> <br>
                          int main() {<br>
                              printf("Hello World!"); <br>
                              return 0;<br>
                            }
                      </p></div>
                </div>
                <div id='admin_opgave1_billeder3' class='tab-pane fade'>
                  <div class='row'>
                      <img src="./images/file.png" alt="" >
                          <h4>File Handling</h4> <br>
                          <p>
                              In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE, and use the fopen() function: <br> <br>
                              FILE *fptr <br>
                              fptr = fopen(filename, mode); <br> <br>
                  
                              FILE is basically a data type, and we need to create a pointer variable to work with it (fptr). For now, this line is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.

                          C (pronounced /si/  like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[7] for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. <br>
              
                      <br>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                      <h2>C Variable</h2> <br>
                      <p>
                          Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. <br> <br>
              
                          In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example: <br>
              
                          int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 <br>
                          float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 <br>
                          char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes <br>
                      </p>
                      <h4>C Variable Names
                      </h4> <br>
                      <p>
                                  All C variables must be identified with unique names. <br>
              
                      These unique names are called identifiers. <br>
              
                      Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). <br>
              
                      <br>
                      The general rules for naming variables are:
                      <br>
              
              Names can contain letters, digits and underscores <br>
              Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_) <br>
              Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables) <br>
              Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.br <br>
              Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names <br>

                      <h2>C Array</h2> <br>
                        
                        <h4>Arrays</h4> <br>
                        <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. <br>
                
                            To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets []. <br> <br>
                            
                            To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces: <br> <br>
                            int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                        </p>
                
                        <h4>Access the element </h4> <br>
                        <p>To access an array element, refer to its index number. <br>
                
                            Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc. <br> <br>
                            
                            This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers: <br> <br>
                
                            int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                            printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);
                        </p></div>
                </div>
                <div id='admin_opgave2_billeder2' class='tab-pane fade'>
                  <div class='row'>
                      <img src="./images/c-function.png" alt="" >
              
                      <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. <br>
              
                          You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. <br>
                          
                          Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p> <br>
                      <h4> Predefined Functions</h4>
              
                      <p>So it turns out you already know what a function is. You have been using it the whole time while studying this tutorial! <br> <br>
              
                          For example, main() is a function, which is used to execute code, and printf() is a function; used to output/print text to the screen: <br> <br>
                          int main() {<br>
                              printf("Hello World!"); <br>
                              return 0;<br>
                            }
                      </p></div>
                </div>
                <div id='admin_opgave2_billeder3' class='tab-pane fade'>
                  <div class='row'>
                      <img src="./images/file.png" alt="" >
                          <h4>File Handling</h4> <br>
                          <p>
                              In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE, and use the fopen() function: <br> <br>
                              FILE *fptr <br>
                              fptr = fopen(filename, mode); <br> <br>
                  
                              FILE is basically a data type, and we need to create a pointer variable to work with it (fptr). For now, this line is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.

                      <p>
                          C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. <br>
              
                          It is a very popular language, despite being old. <br>
                          
                          C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system. <br>

                      <p>
                          It is one of the most popular programming language in the world <br>
                          If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar <br>
                          C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python <br>
                          C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies <br>

                          <h4>File Handling</h4> <br>
                          <p>
                              In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE, and use the fopen() function: <br> <br>
                              FILE *fptr <br>
                              fptr = fopen(filename, mode); <br> <br>
                  
                              FILE is basically a data type, and we need to create a pointer variable to work with it (fptr). For now, this line is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.

                            C (pronounced /si/  like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[7] for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. <br>
                
                        <br>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                        <h2>C Variable</h2> <br>
                        <p>
                            Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. <br> <br>
                
                            In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example: <br>
                
                            int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 <br>
                            float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 <br>
                            char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes <br>
                        </p>
                        <h4>C Variable Names
                        </h4> <br>
                        <p>
                                    All C variables must be identified with unique names. <br>
                
                        These unique names are called identifiers. <br>
                
                        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). <br>
                
                        <br>
                        The general rules for naming variables are:
                        <br>
                
                Names can contain letters, digits and underscores <br>
                Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_) <br>
                Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables) <br>
                Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.br <br>
                Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names <br>
                        </p>

                          <h4>Arrays</h4> <br>
                          <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. <br>
                  
                              To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets []. <br> <br>
                              
                              To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces: <br> <br>
                              int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                          </p>
                  
                          <h4>Access the element </h4> <br>
                          <p>To access an array element, refer to its index number. <br>
                  
                              Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc. <br> <br>
                              
                              This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers: <br> <br>
                  
                              int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                              printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);
                          </p></div>

                        <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. <br>
                
                            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. <br>
                            
                            Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p> <br>

                            For example, main() is a function, which is used to execute code, and printf() is a function; used to output/print text to the screen: <br> <br>
                            int main() {<br>
                                printf("Hello World!"); <br>

                        <p>
                            Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. <br> <br>
                
                            In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example: <br>
                
                            int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 <br>
                            float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 <br>
                            char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes <br>
                        </p>
                        <h4>C Variable Names
                        </h4> <br>
                        <p>
                                    All C variables must be identified with unique names. <br>
                
                        These unique names are called identifiers. <br>
                
                        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). <br>
                
                        <br>
                        The general rules for naming variables are:
                        <br>
                
                Names can contain letters, digits and underscores <br>
                Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_) <br>
                Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables) <br>
                Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.br <br>
                Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names <br>

                          <h4>Arrays</h4> <br>
                          <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. <br>
                  
                              To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets []. <br> <br>
                              
                              To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces: <br> <br>
                              int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                          </p>
                  
                          <h4>Access the element </h4> <br>
                          <p>To access an array element, refer to its index number. <br>
                  
                              Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc. <br> <br>
                              
                              This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers: <br> <br>
                  
                              int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
                              printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);
                          </p></div>

                        <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. <br>
                
                            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. <br>
                            
                            Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p> <br>
                        <h4> Predefined Functions</h4>
                
                        <p>So it turns out you already know what a function is. You have been using it the whole time while studying this tutorial! <br> <br>
                
                            For example, main() is a function, which is used to execute code, and printf() is a function; used to output/print text to the screen: <br> <br>
                            int main() {<br>
                                printf("Hello World!"); <br>
                                return 0;<br>

                            <h4>File Handling</h4> <br>
                            <p>
                                In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE, and use the fopen() function: <br> <br>
                                FILE *fptr <br>
                                fptr = fopen(filename, mode); <br> <br>
                    
                                FILE is basically a data type, and we need to create a pointer variable to work with it (fptr). For now, this line is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.

                        <h4>What is C?</h4>
                        <p>
                            C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. <br>
                
                            It is a very popular language, despite being old. <br>
                            
                            C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system. <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Why Learn C?</h4> <br>
                        <p>
                            It is one of the most popular programming language in the world <br>
                            If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar <br>
                            C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python <br>
                            C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies <br>

                        <p>
                            C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax  <br>
                            The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not

                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>
                            C (pronounced /si/  like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly[7] for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. <br>
                
                        <br>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                            <h4>File Handling</h4> <br>
                            <p>
                                In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE, and use the fopen() function: <br> <br>
                                FILE *fptr <br>
                                fptr = fopen(filename, mode); <br> <br>
                    
                                FILE is basically a data type, and we need to create a pointer variable to work with it (fptr). For now, this line is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.
